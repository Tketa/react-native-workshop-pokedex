# React-Native Workshop Pokedex
30 min workshop to build a basic Pokedex to show the power of React-Native

Many thanks to https://github.com/satya164/PocketGear for the UX/UI and some of the code in this workshop.

## Steps

Clone this repository on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Tketa/react-native-workshop-pokedex.git
```

And open the project in Expo. To do that, download the Expo XDE and open the project.

You should see the base Expo app. We will build from there.

Before we start, fetch all the branches of the project:

```
git fetch --all
```

## Display an ugly list of Pokemons

```
git checkout 1-list-pokemons
```

## Display a nice list of Pokemons

```
git checkout 2-list-pokemon-cards
```

## Display a grid view of Pokemons

```
git checkout 3-grid-display
```

## Allow for filtering Pokemons based on their names

```
git checkout 4-add-search
```
