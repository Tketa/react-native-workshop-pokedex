# React-Native Workshop Pokedex
30 min workshop to build a basic Pokedex to show the power of React-Native

Many thanks to https://github.com/satya164/PocketGear for the UX/UI and some of the code in this workshop.

## Steps

Clone this repository on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Tketa/react-native-workshop-pokedex.git
```

Install the dependencies

```
cd react-native-workshop-pokedex
npm install
```

And open the project in Expo XDE.

You should see the base Expo app (just a blank screen saying "Open up App.js to start working on your app!"). We will build from there.

Before we start, fetch all the branches of the project:

```
git fetch --all
```

## Display an ugly list of Pokemons

```
git checkout 1-list-pokemons
```

## Display a nice list of Pokemons

```
git checkout 2-list-pokemon-cards
```

## Display a grid view of Pokemons

```
git checkout 3-grid-display
```

## Allow for filtering Pokemons based on their names

```
git checkout 4-add-search
```

## Replace Pokemon Sprite by an Image on the phone

```
git checkout 5-change-image
```
